Problems and Suggestions

**Publicly Accessible RDS Instance (Line ~35)**

Issue: The DbInstance is set to publicly_accessible=True, which poses a significant security risk.
Suggestion: RDS instances should generally not be publicly accessible. Use a private subnet for the database instead.

**Insecure RDS Credentials (Line ~40)**
Issue: The database credentials are hardcoded and use SecretValue.unsafe_plain_text.
Suggestion: Use AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and retrieve credentials using rds.Credentials.from_secret.

**Incorrect Security Group Rules (Line ~55)**
Issue: The database security group allows all inbound traffic (ec2.Port.all_traffic), which is is not followng the principal of least previllage .
Suggestion: Restrict inbound traffic to specific ports (e.g., 3306 for MySQL and 5432 for PostgreSQL) and only from trusted sources (e.g., the EC2 security group).

**Redundant Public Subnets for RDS (Line ~48)**
Issue: The RDS instance is placed in public subnets, which contradicts best practices for database placement.
Suggestion: Use private subnets for RDS instances by specifying ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_NAT in vpc_subnets.

**Ingress and Egress Rules for EC2 (Line ~70)**
Issue: The EC2 instance security group allows ingress on port 443 but doesn't allow HTTP (port 80), which is required for a web application. Additionally, the egress rules for port 5432 and port 3306 are added but might not align with the actual application needs.
Suggestion: Update the ingress rules to allow traffic on ports 80 and 443. Confirm that egress rules align with the database's protocol (MySQL or PostgreSQL).

**Misconfigured Security Group Rules for Egress (Line ~71)**
Issue: The syntax for adding egress rules to the EC2 security group is invalid (peer=self.db_security_group is duplicated).
Suggestion: Correct the egress rule syntax. Ensure only the required database protocol is allowed (3306 for MySQL or 5432 for PostgreSQL, not both).

**Unclear Database Engine Choice (Line ~43)**
Issue: The DbInstance is configured for PostgreSQL (PostgresEngineVersion.VER_16_4), but the ingress rules mention MySQL ports (3306).
Suggestion: Clarify whether PostgreSQL or MySQL is the intended database and adjust ports, engine, and rules accordingly.

**Excessive IP Range in Security Groups (Lines ~51, ~68)**
Issue: Both security groups (DbSecurityGroup and Ec2SecurityGroup) allow ingress from ec2.Peer.any_ipv4(), which permits all traffic from the internet.
Suggestion: Restrict access to specific trusted IP ranges or internal VPC sources.

**IAM Role for EC2 Missing (Line ~83)**
Issue: No IAM role is attached to the EC2 instance, which means it won't have any permissions to interact with AWS services (e.g., RDS or S3).
Suggestion: Create and attach an IAM role with least-privilege permissions necessary for the application.

Other recommendations 

**EBS Volume Size (Line ~78)**

Issue: The EBS volume size for the EC2 instance is only 8 GiB, which might be insufficient for a production web application.
Suggestion: Evaluate storage requirements and increase the volume size if necessary.

**Improper Subnet Configuration Name  (Line ~13)**
Issue: The subnet configuration name "Public" is overly generic.Write good naming conventions 
Suggestion: Use a more descriptive name like "WebAppPublicSubnet" to reflect its purpose.

**Lack of Tags**
Issue: Resources like VPC, EC2, and RDS lack tags, which are essential for cost management and resource tracking.
Suggestion: Add tags using the Tags.of(resource).add("key", "value") method to improve resource organization.
